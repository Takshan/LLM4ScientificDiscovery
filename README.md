Groundbreaking advancements in natural language processing have culminated in the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which have showcased remarkable capabilities across a vast array of domains. In this report, we delve into the performance of **LLMs within the context of scientific discovery**, focusing on GPT-4. Our investigation spans a diverse range of scientific areas encompassing **drug discovery, biology, computational chemistry (density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD)), materials design, and partial differential equations (PDE)**. Evaluating GPT-4 on scientific tasks is crucial for uncovering its potential across various research domains, validating its domain-specific expertise, accelerating scientific progress, optimizing resource allocation, guiding future model development, and fostering interdisciplinary research. Our exploration methodology primarily consists of expert-driven case assessments, which offer qualitative insights into the model's comprehension of intricate scientific concepts and relationships, and occasionally benchmark testing, which quantitatively evaluates the model's capacity to solve well-defined domain-specific problems. Our preliminary exploration indicates that **GPT-4 exhibits promising potential for a variety of scientific applications, demonstrating its aptitude for handling complex problem-solving and knowledge integration tasks**. Broadly speaking, we evaluate GPT-4's knowledge base, scientific understanding, scientific numerical calculation abilities, and various scientific prediction capabilities.

# Observation and Summary

## Drug Discovery
* üëçBroad Knowledge: GPT-4 demonstrates a wide-ranging understanding of key concepts in drug discovery, including individual drugs, target proteins, general principles for small-molecule drugs, and the challenges faced in various stages of the drug discovery process. 
* üëçVersatility in Key Tasks: LLMs, such as GPT-4, can help in several essential tasks in drug discovery, including Molecule Manipulation, Drug-Target Binding Prediction, Molecule Property Prediction, Retrosynthesis Prediction and so on.
* üëéSMILES Sequence Processing Challenges: GPT-4 may struggle with directly processing SMILES sequences. To improve the model‚Äôs understanding and output, it is better to provide the names of drug molecules along with their descriptions, if possible.
